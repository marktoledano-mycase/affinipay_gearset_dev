    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


Your request to change your subscription is invalid as you are not an Admin User on your firm’s account. Please have an Admin User send a separate request to subscription.change@mycase.com in order to switch your subscription to the basic plan.


Please contact support with any questions here between the hours of 6am - 5pm PT; we’d be happy to help you.


Sincerely,

The MyCase Team</textOnly>
