    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for reaching out to change your subscription. Your request has been received and your account will automatically switch to the basic tier on your next billing date after March 1st, 2022. To view details about your subscription and billing information, login to your MyCase account, then navigate to the Billing Plan section of Firm Settings. (For step by step instructions, click here.)


The attached document outlines what your basic plan will and will not include. Please review to make sure you will still have access to all the specific features you are currently using, as basic is a more limited plan.


If you change your mind, please send an email to billing@mycase.com and we’ll cancel your change request (up to 2 business days before your next billing date).


Please contact support with any questions here between the hours of 6am - 5pm PT; we’d be happy to help you.



Sincerely,

The MyCase Team</textOnly>
