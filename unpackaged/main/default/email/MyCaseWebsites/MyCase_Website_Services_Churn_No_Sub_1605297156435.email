<br />
If you have plans to reactivate your subscription, <b>please reach out to websites@mycase.com</b> so I can maintain your website on our server.&nbsp;If I do not receive a response or see changes to your account by __ENTER DATE__, your site will be deactivated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have included our customer service contact info below if you have any questions regarding updating payment information.&nbsp;<br />
