<br />
Thank you for speaking with me over the phone this&nbsp;<em><strong>[morning/afternoon]</strong></em>. We recognize that it can be difficult to know where to begin to locate your domain registrar's details. With hopes to make this process a little easier, we've put together a list of ways to narrow down your search â€” which can be viewed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mycasewebhub.com/ways-to-find-where-your-domain-is-located">here</a>. Once you have regained access to the account which holds your domain, please reach out to us to complete the upgrade of your site to our new platform.<br />
<br />
We look forward to assisting you. Let us know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.<br />

Thank you,<br />
