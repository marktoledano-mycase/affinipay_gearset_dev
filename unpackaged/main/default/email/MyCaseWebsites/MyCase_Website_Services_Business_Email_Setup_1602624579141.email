<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We received your inquiry regarding the setup of a business e-mail.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Although MyCase does not provide email services; we can help update your DNS information once you decide which e-mail service to use. Many of our clients find the email services of Gmail or Microsoft 365 to be a user-friendly and effective solution. Once you have selected your preferred e-mail service, please follow these steps:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1) Start the registration process for the business e-mail service.&nbsp;<br />
2) Once you have reached the step where you must Verify Your Domain, please contact our team for assistance. The e-mail service will provide a TXT, MX, CName, or Meta-Tag verification that our team will use to validate your ownership of the website.&nbsp;<br />
3) Once the domain has been verified, proceed to the next step in the registration process.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please let us know if you have additional questions!<br />
