    <description>A list of all active, unmanaged validation rules. The purpose is for post-sandbox refresh, so that we can keep track of which validation rules we turn off to run the postSandboxRefresh batch classes. While turning off the validation rules, a list of custom data is created so that we can turn them on again after the post sandbox refresh batch classes have completed</description>
